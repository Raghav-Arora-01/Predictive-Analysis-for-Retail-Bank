## Conclusion
Most classification problems in the real world are imbalanced. Also, almost always data sets have missing values. In this post, we covered strategies to deal with both missing values and imbalanced data sets. We also explored different ways of building ensembles in sklearn. Below are some takeaway points:

> Sometimes we may be willing to give up some improvement to the model if that would increase the complexity much more than the percentage change in the improvement to the evaluation metrics.

> When building ensemble models, try to use good models that are as different as possible to reduce correlation between the base learners. We couldâ€™ve enhanced our stacked ensemble model by adding Dense Neural Network and some other kind of base learners as well as adding more layers to the stacked model.

> Easy Ensemble usually performs better than any other resampling methods.
